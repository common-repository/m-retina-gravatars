Deprecated in favor of built-in WP functionality

== Description ==

This plugin used to make gravatars load twice bigger images than requested by themes and plugins for crispier display on retina screens.

WordPress 4.4, however, adds this functionality, so the plugin is no longer needed, thus deprecated.

You should most probably deactivate and delete it.

== Installation ==

Simply download and activate it. No additional setup is required.
